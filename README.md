# thithuqs-remastered
This is my project, got inspirated from a project by @tiendung1510. I remastered it with React, ES6, Redux, Webpack.
### Why this?
One day, i decided to learn JavaScript, then what front-end library/framework should i choice?
Then i immediately chose with React, i thought how would it be built with React? Is it easier or harder than the static site using only HTML/CSS? 
### What i learned
-  ECMAScript 6 features (arrow functions, import and export, template literals)
- React fundamentals (State, Components, Props, Lifecycle,...)
- Redux (connecting components, managing states, dispatching actions)
- Webpack (building bundle file for production to optimize performance)

 ### Status : <b><i>ready</b></i>
 Site is ready on : [GitHub page](https://hyperion0201.github.io/thithuqs-remastered/)
 
 An Android (WebView) version is also made. Get it [here](https://github.com/hyperion0201/thithuqs-remastered/releases/download/v1.0/ThiThuQS-RM.apk).
